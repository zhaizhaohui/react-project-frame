# React-Project-Frame

## Why am I doing this project?

After downloading the React framework, there are still many basic configurations that need to be done before you can use it, such as setting up directory structure, importing commonly used dependencies, and configuring files. 

I created this project and simplified the original framework files while also completing the basic configuration work. I hope to provide everyone with a ready-to-use framework that saves time on basic configuration.

 If you need to make additional configurations, you can adjust them yourself.



## The directory structure
